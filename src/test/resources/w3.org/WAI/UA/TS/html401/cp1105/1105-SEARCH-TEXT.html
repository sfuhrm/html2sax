<h3>Procedure</h3>
<ol>
<li>Using the keyboard or an assistive technology that emulates the keyboard, search this page for the text string "Hulks".</li>
<li>Using the keyboard or an assistive technology that emulates the keyboard, search this page again for the text string "Hulks".</li>
</ol>
<h3>Run test</h3>
<div class="test">
<h3 class="test-code">Paragraph 1</h3>
<p class="test">
					It was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose.  "I tell you
					what, young fellow," said she, "I didn't bring you up by hand to
					badger people's lives out.  It would be blame to me, and not praise,
					if I had.  People are put in the Hulks because they murder, and
					because they rob, and forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they
					always begin by asking questions.  Now, you get along to bed!"
				</p>
<h3 class="test-code">Paragraph 2</h3>
<p class="test">
					I was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went
					upstairs in the dark, with my head tingling - from Mrs. Joe's
					thimble having played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her last
					words - I felt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the
					Hulks were handy for me.  I was clearly on my way there.  I had begun
					by asking questions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe.

<h3>Expected results</h3>
<ol>
<li>Using the input configuration of the default user agent bindings, the user can locate the text string "Hulks" in "Paragraph 1".</li>
<li>Using the input configuration of the default user agent bindings, the user can search again for the text string "Hulks" and locate it in "Paragraph 2".</li>
