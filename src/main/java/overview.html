		Html2sax is a DFA-based parser for HTML pages. 
		The motivation is easy. Many HTML pages out there are not
		standard conform. The web-browsers have special parsers that try to
		repair the problematic webpages before displaying them. This can
		get quite complex because there are many alternatives fixing something
		wrong.
		<h3>Design</h3>
		Html2sax is designed to be the frontend of a web-spider reading websites.
		It can handle (almost?) all error situations, but will not try to
		correct problematic HTML pages. It operates on a very low level and is quite fast.
		Tests showed that it is twice as fast as Html-Tidy.
		It will replace HTML entities like <code>"&amp;amp;"</code> to <code>"&aml;"</code>.
		If you need correct HTML documents you can repair your documents yourself.

		<h3>Restrictions</h3>
		There are several restrictions for Html2sax that you should be aware of:
		<ul>
		<li> HTML is not XML. This means SAX is an API for this kind of callbacks, but most existing
			tools having a SAX input interface will fail with Html2sax input.
		<li> No DTD-support. You need to do your HTML-thinking for yourself.
		<li> Won't protect your parser callback from senseless trash if documents are really weird.
		<li> Won't repair corrupt documents.
		</ul>
		<h3>Requirements</h3>
		The only requirements for the parser is a Java<sup>tm</sup> 1.6 JRE.
		Less Java won't work because of using generics.
		<h3>Usage</h3>
		Usage is quite simple. The following example runs the parser:
		<pre>
		SAXParserFactory factory = SAXParserFactory.newInstance("de.sfuhrm.htmltosax.HtmlToSaxParserFactory", null);
		SAXParser parser = factory.newSAXParser();
		YourCallback s = new YourCallback();
		parser.parse(new InputSource(new URL(args[0]).openStream()), s);
		</pre>

		A working example is in the file <code>Sample.java</code> in the source distribution.
