		<h1>html2sax</h1>
		html2sax is a parser for html documents.
		It reads HTML-documents and creates callback calls using the
		Java<sup>tm</sup> SAX API.
		<h2>Background</h2>
		There are many partly-malformed HTML documents on the
		web. Many page authors don't care about correctness when their
		browser manages to display his page. 
		Web browsers have specially adjusted parsers that can repair
		malformed HTML pages to a certain degree. Unfortunately
		there is no standard for correcting mistakes. So for wrong pages
		every browser behaves differently.
		<br>
		To take a tool into the web you need to parse web pages.
		There is a lot of fancy XML technology out there, but
		HTML is actually no HTML. XHTML is XML, but not very
		wide-spread today.		
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		The intention for the original development was to have a really
		simple HTML parser that just splits up the lexical parts of a
		HTML document (tags, attributes, and text).
		The parser should handle errors gracefully and continue
		after them. It should not try to repair documents because
		the intention was to extract certain parts using 
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">XPath</a>-queries.
		<br>
		There is also a Java version of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtidy">HTML tidy</a>.
		It does its best at repairing malformed HTML documents.
		It works quite ok, but in my opinion it's too much for some
		applications.
		<h2>The library</h2>
		html2sax is designed to be the frontend of a web-spider reading websites.
		It can handle (almost?) all error situations, but will not try to
		correct problematic HTML pages. It operates on a very low level and is quite fast.
		Tests showed that it is twice as fast as Html-Tidy.
		<br>
		html2sax works as a SAX parser. Usually SAX is just designed
		to handle real XML. Don't expect many SAX-supporters to work with
		this 'weak' parser. 
		<br>
		The parser was written using <a href="https://javacc.dev.java.net/">JavaCC</a>
		to support powerful lexical error recovery features.
		
		<h3>Features</h3>
		The parser supports the following features:
		<ul>
		<li> Speed.
		<li> Simple.
		<li> Pure Java<sup>tm</sup>.
		<li> Using the well-understood and fast SAX API.
		<li> JUnit test cases.
		<li> HTML entity expansion (example: "&amp;amp;" gets "&amp;").
		<li> Handles errors gracefully and will continue close to the error.
		<lI> No DTD logic that won't work with many documents anyway.
		<li> No structure-level repairing effors that may fail.
		<li> Full source provided.
		</ul>
		<h3>Restrictions</h3>
		There are several restrictions for html2sax that you should be aware of:
		<ul>
		<li> HTML is not XML. This means SAX is an API for this kind of callbacks, but most existing
			tools having a SAX input interface will fail with html2sax input.
		<li> No DTD-support. You need to do your HTML-thinking for yourself.
		<li> Won't protect your parser callback from senseless trash if documents are really weird.
		<li> Won't repair corrupt documents.
		</ul>
		<h3>Requirements</h3>
		The only requirements for the parser is a Java<sup>tm</sup> 1.5 JRE.
		Less Java won't work because of using generics.
		<h3>Usage</h3>
		Usage is quite simple. The following example runs the parser:
		<pre>
		SAXParserFactory factory = SAXParserFactory.newInstance("de.tynne.htmltosax.HtmlToSaxParserFactory", null);
		SAXParser parser = factory.newSAXParser();
		YourCallback s = new YourCallback();
		parser.parse(new InputSource(new URL(args[0]).openStream()), s);
		</pre>

		A working example is in the file <code>Sample.java</code> in the source distribution.
